d3 visualizations for Chicago Votes 

Background: a non profit political organization in Chicago gave me a Pledge card data set to analyze. The organization distributed pledge cards to individuals in Chicago to mark down local issues that they cared most about ie. Economic stability, Police Accountability etc.

The dataset was about 3000 entries in an excel spreadsheet and contained each personâ€™s name, address, phone number, email address, and issues that they marked down.

Bar Chart: shows visually the total number of people that care about each local issue

Scatter Plot: Aggregated total number of votes by each Zip Code and plotted them by Latitude/ Longitude. The area of the circle represents the total number of votes in that zip code. 

I had about 5 weeks to complete the project. I learned Javascript for the first 2 weeks and then learned d3.
